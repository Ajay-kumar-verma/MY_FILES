// What is an Object 
// Object is a instance of a class 
// Instance means  using same class we can create any number of object 
// with same member and method 

// all class has some properties and method

// Using keyword we can perform  some task 
// but class is more simple

//Declaration 

// All member of class has instantiat scope
// Cant access from outside

// and non static member making thier Object

const  obj=new Person(); //non static member can cal only using its objects
// we can call method wihtout parathesis 
console.log(obj.hi());

// When we create object of any class 
//constructor by default get called whether we define or not
//if we dont define it called default constructor 




// If we want to pass somedata while creating  objects
// we can pass using constructor
